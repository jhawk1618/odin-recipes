        <p>A latke is a type of potato pancake or fritter found in <em>Ashkenazi</em> Jewish cuisine. The dish, which is traditionally served during <strong>Hanukkah</strong>, can be made with grated, shredded, or mashed potatoes. This top-rated recipe is made with shredded russet potatoes, all-purpose flour, an egg, an onion, and salt. The potato latkes are fried in peanut oil.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated onion</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. Place shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li>Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl; save any extra for another use. Add egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
