        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Traditional Turkish baklava, also known as <em>fistikli</em> baklava or pistachio baklava is typically made of phyllo dough, finely crushed pistachios, butter, and a simple syrup made of sugar, water, and lemon juice. <strong>You'll find many variations</strong> of this beautiful dessert from Middle Eastern baklava, where the  simple syrup is scented with rosewater, to Greek baklava with walnuts and a generous sprinkle of cinnamon within.</p>
        <h4>Can you use other nuts?</h4>
        <p>Pistachios or walnuts are the most commonly used nuts. But you don't have to use just one or the other. I love to use a combination of nuts and plenty of them! My favorite thing about this version of Greek baklava is that it uses a mixture of three different nuts--pistachios, walnuts, and hazelnuts-- along with cinnamon, pinch of ground cloves, and a sprinkle of sugar.</p>
