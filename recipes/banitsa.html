        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>7oz phyllo sheets</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the eggs and melted butter to a bowl and mix well together. Stir in the crumbled feta cheese.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 180C/350F.</li>
            <li>Grease a smaller baking pan with butter or line with parchment paper, because the banitsa will probably still stick to the bottom and the sides of the pan when baked.</li>
            <li>Add the first sheet of phyllo dough (it doesn't have to be perfect and you can puzzle pieces together. Spread the filling all over the phyllo sheet in a thin layer. The feta crumbles can stay whole. Make sure to also get the corners and sides. Add another layer or phyllo dough on top.</li>
            <li>Continue until you run out of the egg mixture</li>
            <li>The top layer should be phyllo. Spread a few chunks of butter on top and sprinkle 1/2 cup of water all over.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 30 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Slice and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
