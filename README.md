# odin-recipes
Welcome to my recipe website! This website is a visual representation of my skills using HTML with a basic level of understanding. The site will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Upon completion, this project will showcase the skills that I have learned from "The Odin Project" coursework to demonstrate the following:

    - Utilizing basic HTML elements and tags
    - Creating an HTML Boilerplate
    - Working with text to create headings, paragraphs, bold and italicized characters
    - Implementing ordered and unordered lists
    - Creating both absolute and relative links
    - Incorporating images

Thanks for checking out my first project! I am always open to feedback and constructive criticism.
